# Hasteroids

[**Video demo!**](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CraftyHoarseKingsnake-mobile.mp4)

A WIP asteroids clone in Haskell. The goal of this project was to learn optics (with the `optics` package) and FRP (with `reactive-banana`). I'm currently in the process of translating the game logic to FRP.

The repository also includes a few small FRP demos of non-trivial interactions. See `TestFRP.hs`. For example, [here is](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AdeptEqualKentrosaurus-mobile.mp4) the "move command" behavior such as one might find in an RTS game.
